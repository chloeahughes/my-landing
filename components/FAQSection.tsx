    question: "What is Abodex?",
    answer: "Abodex is a centralized deal management platform for commercial real estate (CRE) teams. It integrates your spreadsheets, emails, and documents into one frictionless workspace, while AI automatically organizes deal data into structured, analyzable intelligence."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Abodex built for?",
    answer: "We designed Abodex for acquisitions teams, investment firms, developers, and brokerages who want to close transactions faster without chasing data across multiple tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Abodex save my team time?",
    answer: "On average, acquisitions teams lose 12â€”30% of their week hunting for deal information across silos. Abodex automatically ingests emails, spreadsheets, and PDFs, maps them to the correct deal, and updates stakeholders in real-time, cutting hours of manual work."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Abodex replace my existing tools?",
    answer: "No. Abodex integrates with the tools you already use. Instead of forcing you to switch platforms, it connects and centralizes your existing workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Abodex offline?",
    answer: "Yes! You can access your firm's files, messages, property information, and Abodex's data extraction tools offline."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to onboard my team?",
    answer: "Most teams are up and running within days. We support fast migration of deal documents and train your team on best practices for centralized workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Abodex priced?",
    answer: "We offer flexible per-seat and enterprise plans depending on team size and deal volume. Contact us for custom pricing."
